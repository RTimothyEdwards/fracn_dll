These files are a variation of the DLL on Caravel, but with
a fractional-N divider with 3 bits, so the feedback divider
can be specified in eighths of an integer.

Therefore from a 10MHz clock, assuming a 70 to 150 MHz
range of the ring oscillator, valid feedback values would
be
	Divider		Oscillator rate
	-------		---------------
	7.0		70 MHz
	7.125		71.25 MHz
	7.25		72.5 MHz
	7.375		73.75 MHz
	7.5		75 MHz
	...
	14.5		145 MHz
	14.625		146.25 MHz
	14.75		147.5 MHz
	14.875		148.75 MHz
	15.0		150 MHz
